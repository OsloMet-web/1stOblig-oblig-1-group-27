            <p>I went to Hvam VGS. This VGS was a school focusing on education related to farming. <br>There were cows, pigs, and horses at the school. <br>Hvam is also a boarding school for students who live far away </p>

                I was a student at UiO. <br><br>The buildings are old but they still give a nice university feeling.
                <br>The cantine is big with many selections of food.<br>Studying there was fun and I have made many good friends.

            <p>I went to Oslo Handelsgymnasium VGS. Throughout the three years I spent at the school, I became increasingly interested in its history. I learned that at one point during WWII the building was used by the Germans as a command center. Below the school they also built a bunker, which is today used to exhibit artifacts and monumental objects from WWII.</p>
